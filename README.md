# DIY ROG BAG

Making my old ROG bagpack to newer version with RGB lights to give a fresh look without spending a lot of money for buying a new one!

## Initial Idea

I saw the new bag of ROG with some really cool RGB lighting effect and looked for its price and it comes out be expensive! Now as a DIY guy I am trying to create same effect with famous WS2812 LED lights AKA Neopixels

Now my bags looks like this! And on right side is the new bag....
